# Sneat Extensions

Extensions is a way to extend the functionality of a base sneat app.

There is a build-in [contactus](../contactus) "extension" that is placed apart as it is always enabled for all apps.

Each extension should have at least 2 libraries:

- `shared` - provides reusable components and services
- `internal` - non exported components and services
