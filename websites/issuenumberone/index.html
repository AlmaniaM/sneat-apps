        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on only what is the most important.</li>
            <li>
                Anyone can nominate and have just 1 active issue at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Only 1 active most important issue per team. 1 per department. e.t.c.
            </li>
            <li>
                Everyone can support (vote) for just 1 other issue. Either within or outside of own team.
            </li>
            <li>
                For a team all issues are shown & sorted by most importance.<br>
                But only 1 is visible outside of your team.<br>
                Get a consensus on what would it be.
            </li>
            <li>
                The most important issue gets an assignee to drive it and a deadline.
            </li>
            <li>
                The issue gets a simple progress bar.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can check what are the most important issues of teams you are working with.
            </li>
            <li>
                Anyone can see everyone's most important issue. Get to know if you can help.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ask for votes to get support for your most important issue.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <h2>Why it works?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Surfaces the most important issues
                and does not let them sink under the load of day-to-day problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gets managers to be accountable regards sorting out issues for their reports.
            </li>
            <li>
                Facilitates conversations & collaboration.
            </li>
            <li>
                It's OK to have a long hanging issue
                as long as it's still the most important one and there is some progress.
            </li>
