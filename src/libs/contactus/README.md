# Contactus module

The contactus module is organized as other ['../extensions'](../extensions) modules.
But it's not an "_extension_" as it's not a module that can be enabled or disabled.

As other modules it has 2 libraries:

- [`@sneat/contactus/shared`](shared) - provides reusable components and services
- [`@sneat/contactus/internal`](internal) - non exported components and services
